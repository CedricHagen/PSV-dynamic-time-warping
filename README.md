# PSV-dynamic-time-warping
The accompanying code for Hagen et al. (2020, GJI). 

Notes:
-All .m scripts should download in the proper locations to run the example or main algorithm without modification. 
-The .m scripts are commented to provide direction to interested users. We recommend started with DTWPSV_example.m to see how the algorithm functions. DTWPSV_main.m can be modified to load and warp any PSV data the user is interested in. We do not recommend modifying any of the other scripts including dtw_paleomag.m, DTWPSV_Stat.m, or any of the scripts in the private directory. 
-The data utilized in Hagen et al. (2020, GJI) are provided in PSV_Data. DTWPSV_example.m replicates some of the alignments presented in Hagen et al. (2020, GJI).
